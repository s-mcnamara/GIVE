Abstract.  Memory analysis provides the forensic investigator with the means to acquire information not available from traditional hard disk forensics.  Records of open files, encryption keys and memory resident-only malware are just a few examples.  Volatility is a very powerful Open Source tool for analyzing memory, however is has some notable limitations: 1)  It is run from the command line and 2) It produces text output.  These issues can be addressed by providing a GUI front-end and a database back-end.  Additionally, leveraging the database and providing visualization through the GUI can aid the forensic investigator in his/her analysis.  As a proof of concept I have developed such an application which I am calling Graphical Interface to the Volatility Environment or GIVE.  This paper describes GIVE and how it not only addresses the previously mentioned limitations but also provides visualization and the ability to highlight data that could indicate malicious activity.
